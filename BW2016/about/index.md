## About Baltic Way

Baltic Way is a mathematical contest for teams of students
from countries all around the Baltic Sea. The geographical description is understood in a wider sense. The participating countries are  Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Russia (traditionally represented by a team from St. Petersburg), and Sweden. Each participating country sends a team of five high school students. In the contest, each team works together to solve a set of 20 hard math problems in four hours. To achieve this goal, the team has to rely also on cooperation and mutual help. This feature sets the competition apart from most other mathematical contests, where each contestant works on her/his own and competes against all others.  

## History

Baltic Way started in 1990 to commemorate the chain of two million
people demonstrating peacefully for the freedom of the Baltic
nations. Originally only these nations – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania
– participated, but starting in 1992 the contest soon expanded to include all countries
around the Baltic Sea, and all Nordic countries. Finland first hosted
the contest in 1996, a second time in [2006](/BW2006/), and is hosting
it again in 2016.

## Organizers

The 2016 Baltic Way contest will be organized by the [Training Division](/english/) of the Finnish Mathematical Society, in cooperation with the University of Oulu and the Oulu chapter of the Association of Teachers of Mathematical Subjects (MAOL).

The organizing committee consists of [docent Matti Lehtinen][matti],
[docent Anne-Maria Ernvall-Hytönen][anne-maria], lecturer Eero Ijäs
([MAOL][maol]), [Bachelor of Science Kati Kyllönen][kati]
([OuLUMA][ouluma]), and lecturer Maija-Liisa Spangar.  The scientific
advisory committee comprises [Docent Kerkko Luosto][kerkko],
[Dr Antti Honkela][antti], [Dr Jouni Seppänen][jouni] and
[Master of Science Joni Teräväinen][joni].

The organizing committee is looking for further sponsors. Sponsors
have a unique opportunity to reach a set of talented pre-university
students from all countries around the Baltic Sea who are able to
compete in mathematics at an international level. This is ideal for
companies seeking mathematically talented interns or employees as well
as educational institutions looking for students. Most participants
are likely to be seeking a university-level education in mathematics,
computer science or other fields where they can use their mathematical
skills.

Sponsors receive publicity on the web site and printed materials, and
the competition site (e.g. posters at the reception desk). Depending
on the sponsorship level, short invited talks may be accommodated.
