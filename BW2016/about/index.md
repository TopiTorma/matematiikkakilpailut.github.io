## About Baltic Way

Baltic Way is a mathematical contest for teams of students
from countries all around the Baltic Sea. The geographical description is understood in a wider sense. The participating countries are  Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Russia (traditionally represented by a team from St. Petersburg), and Sweden. Each participating country sends a team of five high school students. In the contest, each team works together to solve a set of 20 hard math problems in four hours. To achieve this goal, the team has to rely also on cooperation and mutual help. This feature sets the competition apart from most other mathematical contests, where each contestant works on her/his own and competes against all others.  

### History

Baltic Way started in 1990 to commemorate the chain of two million
people demonstrating peacefully for the freedom of the Baltic
nations. Originally only these nations – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania
– participated, but starting in 1992 the contest soon expanded to include all countries
around the Baltic Sea, and all Nordic countries. Finland first hosted
the contest in 1996, a second time in [2006](/BW2006/), and is hosting
it again in 2016.
