## About Baltic Way

Baltic Way is a mathematical contest for teams of students
from countries all around the Baltic Sea.

### History

Baltic Way started in 1990 to commemorate the chain of two million
people demonstrating peacefully for the freedom of the Baltic
nations. Originally only these nations – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania
– participated, but the contest soon expanded to include all countries
around the Baltic Sea, and all Nordic countries. Finland first hosted
the contest in 1996, a second time in [2006](/BW2006/), and is hosting
it again in 2016.

## Organizers

[Training Division](/english/) of the Finnish Mathematical Society, in cooperation with the University of Oulu and the Oulu chapter of the Association of Teachers of Mathematical Subjects (MAOL).
