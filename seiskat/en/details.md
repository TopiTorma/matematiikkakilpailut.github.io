The regional competitions are organized in Helsinki, Oulu, Satakunta
and Turku.  The competitions are separate from each other and in
different regions they have different problems.  This means that the
results of different regions are not comparable.

The first round of the competition is held in schools and a final
round in the university.  In each city, the best twenty contestants or
so are invited to the final round. Furthermore, the top contestants
are invited to participate in mathematics training.

## Information for Teachers

### Before the competition

* Photocopying of the problem and answer sheets: Since we do not know
  how many participants there will be from each school, or which
  languages they prefer to use, we will mail only one copy of each
  translation of the problem sheet, and one copy of the answer sheet.
* The problems and answer sheets will be mailed to the schools in
  Finnish, Swedish and English in February.
* The schools are allowed to translate the first round problems to
  other languages, if necessary.

### At the beginning of the competition

* Because it is very important that each answer sheet has the name,
  address and school of the contestant written legibly on it, it is
  prudent to reserve around five minutes for filling in these details
  before the competition.
* The contestants only need writing and drawing instruments,
  i.e. pencils, an eraser, a ruler and a compass. In particular,
  calculators and mathematical tables are not allowed.
* The problems of the first round are in multiple choice format. Each
  problem is worth one point. Wrong answers are not punished. The
  problems are not ordered in increasing difficulty, but the first
  problems are likely to be easier than the last ones.
* It is advisable to stress to the contestants that the problems are
  meant to be difficult and therefore they shouldn't be worried if
  they can not solve most of them.

### During the competition

* The time allotted is 50 minutes. It is preferable to have a visible
  clock in the contest hall, or to warn the contestants when the
  competition is about to end.
* It is very important that the contestants are provided with enough
  scrap paper.

### After the competition

* After the first round, it is only necessary to collect the answer
  sheets and mail them to the address:
  * in Helsinki: Ilmari Kangasniemi, Matematiikan ja tilastotieteen
    laitos, PL 68, 00014 Helsingin yliopisto.
  * in Oulu: Kati Kyll&ouml;nen / HR335, Koulutuspalvelut, PL 8000,
    90014 Oulun yliopisto.
  * in Satakunta: Nadja Eckhardt, Satakunnan ammattikorkeakoulu, PL
    1001, 28101 PORI.
  * in Turku: Anne-Maria Ernvall-Hyt&ouml;nen, Matematik och
    statistik, &Aring;bo Akademi, Domkyrkotorget 1, 20500 &Aring;bo.
* It is prudent to mail the answer sheets as soon as possible after
  the first round.
