The regional competitions are organized in Helsinki, Oulu and Turku.
The competitions are separate from each other and in different cities they have different problems.
This means that the results of different cities are not comparable.<p>

The first round of the competition is held in schools and a final round in the university.
In each city, the best twenty contestants or so are invited to the final round. Furthermore, the top contestants may also participate in mathematics training.</p><p>




<div class="vali">Information for Teachers</div><p></p>

<strong>Before the competition</strong>

<ul><li>Photocopying of the problem and answer sheets: Since we do not know how many participants there will be from each school, or which languages they prefer to use, we will mail only one copy of each translation of the problem sheet, and one copy of the answer sheet.</li>

<li>The problems and answer sheets will be mailed to the schools in Finnish, Swedish and English in February.</li>

<li>The schools are allowed to translate the first round problems to other languages, if necessary.</li></ul>

<strong>At the beginning of the competition</strong>

<ul><li> Because it is very important that each answer sheet has the name, address and school of the contestant written legibly on it, it is prudent to reserve around five minutes for filling in these details before the competition.</li>

<li> The contestants only need writing and drawing instruments, i.e. pencils, an eraser, a ruler and a compass. In particular, calculators and mathematical tables are not allowed.</li>

<li>The problems of the first round are in multiple choice format. Each problem is worth one point. Wrong answers are not punished. The problems are not ordered in increasing difficulty, but the first problems are likely to be easier than the last ones.</li>

<li>It is advisable to stress to the contestants that the problems are meant to be difficult and therefore they shouldn't be worried if they can not solve most of them.</li></ul>

<strong>During the competition</strong>

<ul><li>The time allotted is 50 minutes. It is preferable to have a visible clock in the contest hall, or to warn the contestants when the competition is about to end.</li>

<li>It is very important that the contestants are provided with enough scrap paper.</li></ul>

<strong>After the competition</strong>

<ul><li>After the first round, it is only necessary to collect the answer sheets and mail them to the address:
<ul><li>in Helsinki: Jenni R&auml;s&auml;nen, Summamutikka-keskus, PL 68, 00014 Helsingin yliopisto.</li>
<li>in Oulu: Emma Lepp&auml;l&auml;,  Matemaattisten tieteiden laitos, PL 3000, 90014 OULUN YLIOPISTO.</li>
<li>in Turku: lehtori Jyrki Lahtonen, Matematiikan laitos, 20014 Turun yliopisto.</li></ul>

<li>It is prudent to mail the answer sheets as soon as possible after the first round.</li></ul>
